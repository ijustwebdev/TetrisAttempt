# TetrisAttempt
What works:
it displays a playfield which is generated using javascript :)
t shaped pieces can be created and move down the board using their current and next index
pieces move according to "gravity" automatically and stop once they reach the bottom of the playfield
pieces can move left and right restricted by the playfield bounds

I got to do some fun javascript tricks with this one.
